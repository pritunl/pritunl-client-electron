Hello guys. 

You guys seem smart. 

...BUT...

You know what's not smart? 

The key you tell people to add to their package managers not existing on any key servers!

This means your average pleb (those poor bastards) they cannot install the software. It's kinda not good.

You know what? I bet a lot of people just gave up and didn't install it. Must have.

Must be good for business. I wonder how long that has gone on?

Please guys. Come on. Please fix it. Would be a nice late christmas present from you to me. Thanks guys. Love it.
